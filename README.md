# Locality-Sensitive Hashing & Recommendation System

In this assignment, we worked with a sample Yelp dataset with user ratings. We will firstly implement an LSH algorithm, using both Cosine and Jaccard similarity measurement, to find similar products according to the rating of users. Second, We will implement different types of collaborative-filtering recommendation systems to predict for the ratings/stars for given user ids and business ids.
